# fizzbuzz
Put together a quick object for FizzBuzz - although made it so you can pass parameters for which ever values you want....range to evaluate and which numbers to divide by. It defaults to 1-50 and 3,5.

But if you wanted to evaluate from 1-100
`new FizzBuzz(100)`

If you want to evaluate 4,6
`new FizzBuzz(50, 4, 6)`

If you want to evaluate 3,5 in the range 50-100
`new FizzBuzz(100, 3, 5, 50)`


I know ideally I wouldn't instantiate the class within the same file...but this is really just for example purpose...
